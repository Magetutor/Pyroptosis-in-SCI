# Pyroptosis-in-SCI

This is the code set for maunscript: Dynamic Changes in Pyroptosis Following Spinal Cord Injury and the Identification of Crucial Molecular Signatures Through Machine Learning and Single-Cell Sequencing. 

Pyroptosis is a very important pathological mechanism following spinal cord injury, as it can hinder the repair of the injury. Therefore, exploring the dynamic changes and key molecules of pyroptosis after spinal cord injury is beneficial for targeting pyroptosis to repair spinal cord injury. First, we included 94 pyroptosis-related genes and analyzed the dynamic changes of pyroptosis at different times post-injury. At the same time, we analyzed the main cell types undergoing pyroptosis and the key molecules related to pyroptosis, finding that inflammatory microglia are the main cell types undergoing pyroptosis, and identified four key molecules related to pyroptosis.
